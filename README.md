# MultiBank Memory Design in SystemVerilog

## Overview

![multibank](/image/preview.png)

The project explores the concept of multibank memory systems as a particular solution of multiport memory problem. The aims of the project is to find the optimal number of banks to minimize conflicts and maximize throughput, as described in the article _"Multibank memory bandwidth analysis in on-chip system."_ [(link)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355220832_Multibank_memory_bandwidth_analysis_in_on-chip_system?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6ImhvbWUiLCJwYWdlIjoicHJvZmlsZSIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6ImhvbWUiLCJwb3NpdGlvbiI6InBhZ2VDb250ZW50In19)

- __Scalebility__: you can ajast the parameters of ports and banks

## Project Details

- **Course:** Digital Circuit Design
- **University:** Innopolis University
- **Authors:** [Artem Voronov](https://github.com/Vor-Art) and [Roman Voronov](https://github.com/V-Roman-V)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Modelsim or QuestaSim

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vor-Art/DCD_MultiBankMemory.git
    cd DCD_MultiBankMemory/src
    ```

2. Launch test and display results:

    ```bash
    modelsim -do ./run.do
    cat test_results.txt
    ```

> Note: you can specify the test by setting the parameter `test_id` in `run.do`:  
test_id=0: __Direct test__ - each port access to only one uniformly chosen bank;  
test_id=1: __Random test__ - Each port access to random addresses each time  
test_id=2: todo...
